## Go

### show tags for Go

> From [vim-go](https://github.com/fatih/vim-go):
> `Tagbar` support to show tags of the source code in a sidebar with `gotags`

if you have already installed [vim-go](https://github.com/fatih/vim-go), run `:GoInstallBinaries` to
install `gotags` and other packages; and you can install `tagbar` from [majutsushi/tagbar](https://github.com/majutsushi/tagbar).
